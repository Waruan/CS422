<h>User Profile</h>		
  <p>We used icons for accessing any setting on application on the mirror because icons have become universal, anyone can tell the</p>
    <p>weather icon by looking at the sun or the music icon by looking at the music note. We made preferred language a setting that </p>
    <p>can later be changed. There is no gender difference for mirrors. We expect the user to be at a reasonable age as anyone</p>
    <p>who can use a smartphone can use the mirror with ease.</p>
<h>novice / first time users</h>
    <p>First time users will have an easy time understanding using our mascot as a way to ask for help. The bird will be there only during the first time you use the mirror. Also buttons will be easily</p>
    <p>recognizable. Consistency with buttons and layout. Buttons are in arm length for easy access.</p>
<h>knowledgeable intermittent users</h>
    <p>Just like a phone icons are easily recognizable. Layout is easy to understand and navigate.</p>
    <p>Simple actions to make it easier for the user to perform tasks efficiently.</p>
<h>expert frequent users</h>
    <p>Simple to navigate on a day to day basis. Few clicks to get from one app to another on the mirror.</p>
    <p>Very user friendly in terms of layout and color.</p>
<h>diversity of tasks</h>
    <p>Settings similar to something you would see on a phone. Basic tasks such as calender, music and weather.</p>
    <p>We allow toggling icons rather than dragging them.</p>
