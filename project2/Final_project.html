<img src="Data/3.png" height="400" width="800">
<p> This screen shows how creating a new user looks like. Pressing the + button brings up a keyboard prompting the user to input a username using the keyboard. When finished, press "Go". </p>
<img src="Data/4.png" height="400" width="800">
<p> After inputing a username and pressing "Go", this will bring the user to the pin section. Here the user is to enter the pin that the user wishes to be his password. Then the user will be prompted to enter it again as a confirmation.</p>
<img src="Data/5.png" height="400" width="800">
<p> This screen is what the guest user looks like. There are limited apps the guest can use. Facebook, twitter, limited calendar functions and health are not included in the guest mode. Currently selected is the menu that the user can select different applications. Apps that are already on the bottom menu are displayed with a green checkmark. </p>
<img src="Data/6.png" height="400" width="800">
<p> Here this is what happens if you select an existing user. The tab will light up and the user will be prompted to input their specific pin.</p>
<img src="Data/7.png" height="400" width="800">
<p> This is what an existing user screen looks like. Currently the menu is being displayed to show all the apps available to the user compared to the guest user.</p>

<img src="Data/12.png" height="400" width="800">
<p> This is the article application. It will display a list of current articles and also different options for types of articles to read from. This can be modified in the settings. We offer 4 different types of topics "Gaming, Business, Politics, and Tech". The bottom buttons will update depending on what is selected in settings. Default is Gaming, Business and Politics.</p>
